# Cesarops Fleet Lessons Learned

Polisher-curated notes that the orchestrator pushes when fleet members produce code that needed fixing or when a model behavior pattern shows up.

When nautivecs comes online, ingest this file via the `/add` endpoint so `think_harder` can retrieve these lessons automatically.

## [model-behavior,qwen3.6,thinking-mode] 2026-05-16
Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MoE on the local koboldcpp endpoint defaults to a chain-of-thought ("thinking") mode and burns ~70-80% of generation tokens on internal reasoning even when asked for direct code output. The deliverable arrives at the bottom — buried in the reasoning trace.

**Mitigation when dispatching to qwen3.6 family:**
- Strip `<think>...</think>` blocks from the response before treating output as code.
- Or set generation params to forbid the `<think>` open token.
- Prefer Gemma-4-MoE for direct code-generation tasks; route qwen3.6 to actual reasoning tasks (architecture decisions, debugging traces, why-does-this-fail questions).

## [model-behavior,gemma4,code-generation] 2026-05-16
Gemma-4-26B-MoE on koboldcpp produced clean, working Rust speculative-decoder code on a single attempt, with stable softmax, both correction branches, and 2 unit tests. Only post-processing needed: strip the surrounding markdown ```rust fences. Grade A-.

**Use Gemma-4-MoE for:** API-spec-driven code (where a clear API contract is given in the prompt), single-file deliverables, anything that doesn't need architectural reasoning.

## [task-format,patches,brittle] 2026-05-16
Both Gemma-4 and Qwen3.6-A3B fabricate context lines when asked to produce unified diffs. Qwen even hallucinated wgpu API names (`base_groups`, `base_bindings` aren't real `PipelineLayoutDescriptor` fields).

**Don't ask the fleet for diffs.** Ask for full file output (or a clearly-bounded code block), then the orchestrator computes the diff and applies it.

## [tool-wiring,kobold-probe] 2026-05-16
The forge `/cluster/discover` was probing only `/health` to determine if a worker is up. Koboldcpp does NOT expose `/health` — it returns 404. So every kobold worker showed offline despite responding correctly on `/api/extra/version` and `/v1/models`.

**Probe priority:** `/api/extra/version` → `/v1/models` → `/health`. First success wins.

## [tool-wiring,routing,lan-vs-tailscale] 2026-05-16
Forge previously gated all remote service probes behind Tailscale peer state. When the user moved cesarops2 (1070+P1000) and cesarops3 (1060) to LAN IPs (10.0.0.x), they showed permanently offline because Tailscale doesn't see them at LAN addresses.

**Routing rule:** localhost + RFC1918 (10.x / 192.168.x / 172.16.x) → optimistically reachable, port probes decide. Only `100.x` (Tailscale) requires `tailscale status` to confirm reachability. M2200 stays on Tailscale because it's mobile.

## [persistence,toml-edit] 2026-05-16
Forge `update_worker_config` / `update_worker_field` / `update_corrector_function` were TODO stubs that only logged. APPLY buttons and per-card toggles in the cluster panel appeared to work but never persisted to `cluster_config.toml`.

**Fix:** use `toml_edit::DocumentMut` for round-trip preservation of comments + ordering. Inline-tables (like `corrector_functions = { json_fixer = true, ... }`) need `Item::Value(Value::InlineTable(_))` not `Item::Table(_)`.

## [route-table,axum] 2026-05-16
Don't register the same path twice on different handlers in axum 0.8 — it panics on `Router::serve` with "Overlapping method route". Use a distinct path (e.g. `/cluster/config/full` vs `/cluster/config`).

## [path-extractor,axum] 2026-05-16
If the route declares `/cluster/worker/{name}/start` and the handler is `Path<usize>`, every call fails because the path segment is a worker name string. Either match the type to the path param or accept `Path<String>` and resolve internally.
